my first project given by DSA-INCUBATOR HUB after the data analysis training

### PROJECT REVIEW
This analysis project aims to provide insight that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, i seek to get enough insight from this data to make a reasonable decision which in turn enables me to tell compelling stories around my data from the insight derived and also the best performance from the insight and what marketing strategy should be implemented.
