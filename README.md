### PROJECT REVIEW
This analysis project aims to provide insight that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, i seek to get enough insight from this data to make a reasonable decision which in turn enables me to tell compelling stories around my data from the insight derived and also the best performance from the insight and what marketing strategy should be implemented.

* Which categories have product with the highest discount
* Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined


#### Result findings
* Electronices is the product with the highest rating count
* Computer and Accessories has the highest average discount percentage
* category with the highest products is Electronics
* Electronices has the highest potential revenue
* Computer and Accessories is the product category with the highest discount

* providing more discount on categories with low rating count is a strategy the can help improve the consumers review and ratings of the products
